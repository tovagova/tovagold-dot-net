        </section>

        <section class="project-text">
            <p><br>At the beginning of the project, our team spent time brainstorming everyday problems. One issue that all of us had been running into lately was <b>food waste</b>; we all had lost food to spoilage due to crowded fridges, bad cooking habits, or plain forgetfulness. We decided to design an app that would keep track of a household's food inventory, expiration dates, and shopping list.</p>
            <p>With our goal set, we put together a <b>proto-persona</b> to organize our needs, pain points, and assumptions.</p>

        <section class="project-text">
            <p><br>To find out more about our potential users, we wrote and distributed a <b>survey</b> on Google Forms that asked respondents about their grocery-related habits, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Household size</li>
                <li>Whether they share groceries and shopping responsibilities with roommates</li>
                <li>Whether they use a grocery list for shopping (physical or digital)</li>
                <li>What factors contribute to food spoiling in their household</li>

        <section class="project-text">
            <p>As well as the survey, we conducted several <b>one-on-one interviews</b> asking more in-depth questions about grocery shopping timing, process, and frustrations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We learned about a myriad of ways people keep track of their grocery list. We also found that most respondents shop for their housemates or family as well as themselves, and that most respondents also throw away perishables. <b>Over 90%</b> of survey respondents said they would want to be able to see a list of their whole household food inventory, which assured our team that this app was worth designing.</p>

        </section>

        <section class="project-text">
            <p><br>Through our research, we found that <b>most people wanted to reduce their food waste,</b> but ran into obstacles including time constraints, forgetting what food they have already, and the allure of ordering takeout.</p>

            <p>PROBLEM STATEMENT</p>
            <br>
            <p>How might we help people feel that grocery planning and shopping are exciting, simple, and fun, and help them feel confident in their ability to build better habits in terms of reducing their food waste?</p>
        </section>

        <section class="project-text">
            <p><br>At this point, we conducted a <b>competitor analysis</b> and found that most existing grocery list apps were <b>designed for single users</b> and only had simple features like keeping a list of text strings. Our team realized this was a good opportunity to explore adding social features. We synthesized all our research findings into an <b>affinity map</b> and organized it all with an <b>'I Like, I Wish, What If'</b> framework to define our features to build out.</p>
        </section>

        <br><img src="frij-images/likewishwhat.png" width=1200px; class="img-single">
        <br>

        <section class="project-text">
            <p>Because most grocery list apps are for single users, we focused on two social features in particular:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <b>shared shopping list</b> accessible to all members of a household</li>
                <li>A <b>scoreboard</b> where a user and their friends are ranked by a <b>'sustainability score'</b> based on how much food they have used before expiry</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Our goal was to elevate our app from a simple grocery list to an app that would foster a sense of <b>community</b> between users and the people they shared food with by sharing the responsibility of grocery shopping, as well as between households through friendly competition in sustainability.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We also saw potential in Apple's <b>photographic text recognition</b> feature to make it easy to add items to the household inventory by simply taking a photo or screenshot of a grocery receipt.</p>

            <p>Our team was happy with what we built in the three weeks of this project. However, we did have a list of further considerations, had we had more time to work on it, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Additional user testing</li>
                <li>Personalized food waste journey showing environmental impact</li>
                <li>More in-depth sorting and filtering features for inventory</li>
                <li>Build out features for household list sharing</li>
